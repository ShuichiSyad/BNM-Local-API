## Final Words

It was really fun building this API in Laravel. Exploring the features offered by Laravel to help developers create class file, build unit test, and also populate the database with dummy data ! I have never used Laravel, perform unit testing before and this was such a great exposure to me :D

Thank you for the opportunities !
